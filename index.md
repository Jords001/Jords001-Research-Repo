What is Scratch?
What is visual programming?
What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Scratch is a visual coding language made at MIT. It uses blocks and a simple structure to introduce people to programming. I made a few games in Scratch and found it intuitive.

Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses blocks or strings in a visual manner to create a hierachy or structure.

DRY Code, or don't repeat yourself is a principle I have learnt. Basically not repeating code and finding an alternative to shorten lines of code down.

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717591709/fullscreen/ is a scratch project I have enjoyed making as it mixed together animations and game principles.
