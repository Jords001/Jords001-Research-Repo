<p>Scratch is a visual coding language made at MIT. It uses blocks and a simple structure to introduce people to programming. I made a few games in Scratch and found it intuitive.</p>
<p>Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses blocks or strings in a visual manner to create a hierachy or structure.</p>
<p>DRY Code, or don't repeat yourself is a principle I have learnt. Basically not repeating code and finding an alternative to shorten lines of code down.</p>
<br>
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717591709/fullscreen/ is a scratch project I have enjoyed making as it mixed together animations and game principles.
<br>
<p> And here is another I have embeded here, this one is called falling spikes.</p>
<br>
<p>The controls are Left to move left and right to move right as well as space bar to jump (currently serves no purpose and can end your run). You have to dodge the falling spikeball.

What is git?
What is GitHub?
<br>
<p>Git is an opensource version control system used for big and small projects</p>
<p>Github is a host for the version control system git, hosting code for private and public programs that can all be version controlled and used with methods like forking.</p>
