<p><strong>Week 1:</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>What is Scratch?</p>
<p>What is visual programming?</p>
<p>What are some programming principles that you have discovered?</p>
<p>Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?</p>
<br>
___
<br>
<p>Scratch is a visual coding language made at MIT. It uses blocks and a simple structure to introduce people to programming. I made a few games in Scratch and found it intuitive.</p>
<p>Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses blocks or strings in a visual manner to create a hierachy or structure.</p>
<p>DRY Code, or don't repeat yourself is a principle I have learnt. Basically not repeating code and finding an alternative to shorten lines of code down.</p>
<br>
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717591709/fullscreen/ is a scratch project I have enjoyed making as it mixed together animations and game principles.
<br>
<p> And here is another I have embeded here, this one is called falling spikes.</p>
<br>
<p>The controls are Left to move left and right to move right as well as space bar to jump (currently serves no purpose and can end your run). You have to dodge the falling spikeball.

<br>
___
<br>
What is git?
What is GitHub?
<br>
<p>Git is an opensource version control system used for big and small projects</p>
<p>Github is a host for the version control system git, hosting code for private and public programs that can all be version controlled and used with methods like forking.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Week 3:</strong></p>
<br>
What is Python?
What is it used for?
What're you using it for?
<br>
Python is a high level programming language that is interpreted (think error checked) and object oriented programming (is about creating objects that contain both data and functions compared to Procedural programming which is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data).
<br>
Python often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. It is a general purpose language and isn't specialised for specific problems. But it can also be used for other tasks such as making games, machine learning etc.
<br>
Initially I'll be using python to make small scripts, practicing the language and activities set it class. After this I would like to make a game in this language, alternatively I'm not sure and may need to do some further research.
<br>
Sarmad helped me understand someore principles around python and programming, for my first script I delve into something a bit more complex with loops and exceptions. The reasons I did this is because I have prior experience in python and wanted to take on something a bit different.

here are the scripts I have made so far <url>https://github.com/Jords001/Jords001-Research-Repo/tree/main/myPython</url>
<br>
<p><strong>Week 4:</strong></p>
<br>
Roman introduced us to videographs (one such task we participated in in the form of a video train), blockchains as well as cylic graphs.
He also introduced us to some of the machine learning artistic things circulating the industry at the moment. The likes of Dall-E and Midjourney. And a video that uses the technology in a unique way. Mask by FDK Knight otherwise known as Michael Logie. He wanted us to reflect on this and how it made us feel. Roman said he fed the story of Into the Maelstrom by Edgar Allan Poe. About the subtle nuiances about a developing technology and that it's not about this is going to replace artists because that's not what it's about and that it's about this new tool that is available.
<br>
I feel that this emerging technology is interesting, and has it's places but like Roman said that it's not going to replace artists. However I also feel that the art that this technology has already used is art that the artists have spent years developing. Contrary to that, it to me feels like it has the opportunity to go almost anywhere and be just about anything.
<br>
<p><strong>General Reflection:</strong></p>

___
Q:Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

___
Q:What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
<br>

A:Timeboxing is a time management technique that sets a specific amount of time for tasks. I hadn't heard it be called that before but the technique is familiar. It's a possibility, I think if I'm not dedicating enough time/not dedicating time at the right time that I might be more inclined to use it.
___
Q:On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
<br>

A:I'm feeling confident with the assignments, maybe a 3 or 4. However I also have doubts when learning new things whether they relate to the assignments or not which can be confusing at times.
___
Q:What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
<br>

A:Creating some loops and small programs or scripts in python. Starting to learn Godot and gdscript.
___
Q:Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself.
<br>

A:My personal strategy is to follow the content but in a way that interests me. I'd sometimes have to find an extended path to a solution when if I'd followed by just the book I may have come to the conclusion sooner.
___
Q:If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
<br>

A:I have been struggling a bit with anxiety and depression, maybe I'd tell myself it's going to be okay and to use the support networks I have more.
___
Q:Have you developed a habit of exploring?
<br>

A:I'd like to think I have with programming a bit beyond the brief with activites we were given and trying different avenues, sometimes using variables and other times using definitions or functions.
___
Q:Have you meditated before?
<br>

A:I have meditated before, it's something that can be quite refreshing but I feel you need to be open to the concept first

___
Q:Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
<br>

A:Yes, I think it always pays to think differently than a single mindset as otherwise you'll lock yourself into a pattern

___
Q:Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?

Q:Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
<br>

A:One person was doing most of the work, divided into steps so more people could participate together
___
Q:So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
<br>

___
Q:Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
<br>

A:I have. It's self doubting in my ability to code or complete goals. No I don't believe what it says but
___
Q:What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
<br>

A:Minimum Viable Product, I would say this is the point in making something that it becomes useable. You want to make something useable before you give it away.
___
Q:What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
<br>
___
Q:What is pair programming?
<br>

A:Two programmers at one workstation, one writes the code and the other checks and provides guidance. At each goal discussions are made.
___
Q:What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
<br>

A:I'm not sure I have anything specific that I am looking forward to, but generally just learning to program interests me.
___
Q:What is conscious listening?
<br>

A:Conscious listening is being present and aware of both you and the participants feelings and needs.

Q:What is a variable?
<br>

A:A variable is easiest to think of as a storage box which contents can change or be modified depending on the program
