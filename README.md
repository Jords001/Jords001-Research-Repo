## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?

### What is visual programming?

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
___

Scratch is a visual coding language made at MIT. It uses blocks and a simple structure to introduce people to programming. I made a few games in Scratch and found it intuitive.

Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses blocks or strings in a visual manner to create a hierachy or structure.

DRY Code, or don't repeat yourself is a principle I have learnt. Basically not repeating code and finding an alternative to shorten lines of code down.

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717591709/fullscreen/ is a scratch project I have enjoyed making as it mixed together animations and game principles.

## Week 2:

### What is git?

### What is GitHub?
___

Git is an opensource version control system used for big and small projects

Github is a host for the version control system git, hosting code for private and public programs that can all be version controlled and used with methods like forking.

## Week 3:
<br>

What is Python?
What is it used for?
What're you using it for?
<br>

Python is a high level programming language that is interpreted (think error checked) and object oriented programming (is about creating objects that contain both data and functions compared to Procedural programming which is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data).
<br>

Python often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. It is a general purpose language and isn't specialised for specific problems. But it can also be used for other tasks such as making games, machine learning etc.
<br>

Initially I'll be using python to make small scripts, practicing the language and activities set it class. After this I would like to make a game in this language, alternatively I'm not sure and may need to do some further research.
<br>

Sarmad helped me understand someore principles around python and programming, for my first script I delve into something a bit more complex with loops and exceptions. The reasons I did this is because I have prior experience in python and wanted to take on something a bit different.

here are the scripts I have made so far <url>https://github.com/Jords001/Jords001-Research-Repo/tree/main/myPython</url>
<br>

## Week 4:
<br>

Roman introduced us to videographs (one such task we participated in in the form of a video train), blockchains as well as cylic graphs. And an experiment of making a videograph by recording a video at the same time framing one other person and the recording ends when one person leaves any of  the frames. Then we all place the phones on the ground/table and and play them all at the same time.
<br>

I wasn't really worried about being a subject, I've taken part in films in 48 hours before and have made youtube videos etc which has removed any anxiety or shyness I may have once had long ago about being a subject recorded. Sometimes when I see my own image I think momentarily think things that I might like to be different about myself (eg balding hair etc( but I know I should also accept my body and the things that I can't change. We could be evolving with these devices as they're often used to capture our images and our lives. I didn't particularly feel attached to either my phone or my image, I felt I could trust the people around me. This activity could be drawn on to get people to understand each others feelings and to work together as a team.
<br>

He also introduced us to some of the machine learning artistic things circulating the industry at the moment. The likes of Dall-E and Midjourney. And a video that uses the technology in a unique way. Mask by FDK Knight otherwise known as Michael Logie. He wanted us to reflect on this and how it made us feel. Roman said he fed the story of Into the Maelstrom by Edgar Allan Poe. About the subtle nuiances about a developing technology and that it's not about this is going to replace artists because that's not what it's about and that it's about this new tool that is available.
<br>

I feel that this emerging technology is interesting, and has it's places but like Roman said that it's not going to replace artists. However I also feel that the art that this technology has already used is art that the artists have spent years developing. Contrary to that, it to me feels like it has the opportunity to go almost anywhere and be just about anything.
<br>

## Week 5:
<br>

This week we learnt a bit about Agile in working together, a short meeting and pitching ideas to solve each others problems.
<br>

##General Reflection:
<br>

Q:Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
<br>
A:I did try to do this, standing up and walking around/stretching or getting a drink of water etc. However I didn't always remember if I got absorbed in my work
<br>

Q:What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
A:Timeboxing is a time management technique that sets a specific amount of time for tasks. I hadn't heard it be called that before but the technique is familiar. It's a possibility, I think if I'm not dedicating enough time/not dedicating time at the right time that I might be more inclined to use it.

Q:On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
A:I'm feeling confident with the assignments, maybe a 3 or 4. However I also have doubts when learning new things whether they relate to the assignments or not which can be confusing at times.

Q:What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
A:Creating some loops and small programs or scripts in python. Starting to learn Godot and gdscript.

Q:Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself.

A:My personal strategy is to follow the content but in a way that interests me. I'd sometimes have to find an extended path to a solution when if I'd followed by just the book I may have come to the conclusion sooner.

Q:If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
A:I have been struggling a bit with anxiety and depression, maybe I'd tell myself it's going to be okay and to use the support networks I have more.

Q:Have you developed a habit of exploring?
A:I'd like to think I have with programming a bit beyond the brief with activites we were given and trying different avenues, sometimes using variables and other times using definitions or functions.

Q:Have you meditated before?
A:I have meditated before, it's something that can be quite refreshing but I feel you need to be open to the concept first

Q:Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
A:I took a 3D modeling course which I felt gave me some great skills and experience, I felt it took perserverance concentration and dedication

Q:Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
A:I might consider myself a junior developer, but given that I don't know what workloads are in the industry I'm not sure what to measure it against.

Q:Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
A:Yes, I think it always pays to think differently than a single mindset as otherwise you'll lock yourself into a pattern

Q:How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
A:I have 3 tabs open, all related to study. However I often have discord open, talking to friends at the same time, otherwise playing music.

Q:Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
A:I think I have from frustration or mild anger, it pays to walk away and cool down/defuse and come to the problem from a different angle. Rethink the situation.

Q:What is an IDE?
A:An Integrated Developer Environment, a combination of different tools for developing inside of of a single interface or GUI

Q:What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
A:Sometimes it's easier to trial short attempts in theory before settling on something to start with

Q:Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
A:One person was doing most of the work, divided into steps so more people could participate together

Q:So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
A:I'm not sure I can think of a particular moment, but as I said earlier I have been struggling a bit with anxiety which has made general existence a bit rougher at the moment.

Q:What is OOP?
A:Object Oriented Programming

Q:Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
Yes I am, no I'm not finding it overly tedious

Q:What is polymorphism?
A:Polymorphism is the concept in OOP languages that you can use different classes within the same interface. Said classes can provide their own execution of the interface.

Q:Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
A:I have. It's self doubting in my ability to code or complete goals. No I don't believe what it says but

Q:What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A:Minimum Viable Product, I would say this is the point in making something that it becomes useable. You want to make something useable before you give it away.

Q:What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?

Q:What is pair programming?

Q:What are you looking forward to learning about programming?

Q:What is conscious listening?

Q:What is a variable?

Q:What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?

Q:What is something kind that someone has done for you?
A:B from my class helped me understand subnets and ip address conversion to binary

Q:If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

Q:Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?

Q:What is a fixed mindset?

Q:What is something kind you have done for someone else?

Q:Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?

Q:Have you developed a habit of persevering?
