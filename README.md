## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?

### What is visual programming?

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
___

Scratch is a visual coding language made at MIT. It uses blocks and a simple structure to introduce people to programming. I made a few games in Scratch and found it intuitive.

Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses blocks or strings in a visual manner to create a hierachy or structure.

DRY Code, or don't repeat yourself is a principle I have learnt. Basically not repeating code and finding an alternative to shorten lines of code down.

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717591709/fullscreen/ is a scratch project I have enjoyed making as it mixed together animations and game principles.

## Week 2:

### What is git?

### What is GitHub?
___

Git is an opensource version control system used for big and small projects

Github is a host for the version control system git, hosting code for private and public programs that can all be version controlled and used with methods like forking.

## Week 3:
<br>
What is Python?
What is it used for?
What're you using it for?
<br>
Python is a high level programming language that is interpreted (think error checked) and object oriented programming (is about creating objects that contain both data and functions compared to Procedural programming which is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data).
<br>
Python often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. It is a general purpose language and isn't specialised for specific problems. But it can also be used for other tasks such as making games, machine learning etc.
<br>
Initially I'll be using python to make small scripts, practicing the language and activities set it class. After this I would like to make a game in this language, alternatively I'm not sure and may need to do some further research.
<br>
Sarmad helped me understand someore principles around python and programming, for my first script I delve into something a bit more complex with loops and exceptions. The reasons I did this is because I have prior experience in python and wanted to take on something a bit different.

here are the scripts I have made so far <url>https://github.com/Jords001/Jords001-Research-Repo/tree/main/myPython</url>

## Week 4:
<br>
Roman introduced us to videographs (one such task we participated in in the form of a video train), blockchains as well as cylic graphs.
He also introduced us to some of the machine learning artistic things circulating the industry at the moment. The likes of Dall-E and Midjourney. And a video that uses the technology in a unique way. Mask by FDK Knight otherwise known as Michael Logie. He wanted us to reflect on this and how it made us feel. Roman said he fed the story of Into the Maelstrom by Edgar Allan Poe. About the subtle nuiances about a developing technology and that it's not about this is going to replace artists because that's not what it's about and that it's about this new tool that is available.
<br>
I feel that this emerging technology is interesting, and has it's places but like Roman said that it's not going to replace artists. However I also feel that the art that this technology has already used is art that the artists have spent years developing. Contrary to that, it to me feels like it has the opportunity to go almost anywhere and be just about anything.
