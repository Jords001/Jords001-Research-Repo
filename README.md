## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?

### What is visual programming?

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
___

Scratch is a visual coding language made at MIT. It uses blocks and a simple structure to introduce people to programming. I made a few games in Scratch and found it intuitive.

Visual programming is a type of programming language that uses blocks or strings in a visual manner to create a hierachy or structure.

DRY Code, or don't repeat yourself is a principle I have learnt. Basically not repeating code and finding an alternative to shorten lines of code down.

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717591709/fullscreen/ is a scratch project I have enjoyed making as it mixed together animations and game principles.

## Week 2:

### What is git?

### What is GitHub?
___

Git is an opensource version control system used for big and small projects

Github is a host for the version control system git, hosting code for private and public programs that can all be version controlled and used with methods like forking.

## Week 3:
<br>
What is Python?
What is it used for?
What're you using it for?
<br>
Python is a high level programming language that is interpreted (think error checked) and object oriented programming (is about creating objects that contain both data and functions compared to Procedural programming which is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data).
<br>
Python often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. It is a general purpose language and isn't specialised for specific problems. But it can also be used for other tasks such as making games, machine learning etc.
<br>
Initially I'll be using python to make small scripts, practicing the language and activities set it class. After this I would like to make a game in this language, alternatively I'm not sure and may need to do some further research.
<br>
Sarmad helped me understand someore principles around python and programming, for my first script I delve into something a bit more complex with loops and exceptions. The reasons I did this is because I have prior experience in python and wanted to take on something a bit different.

here are the scripts I have made so far <url>https://github.com/Jords001/Jords001-Research-Repo/tree/main/myPython</url>
<br>
## Week 4:
<br>
Roman introduced us to videographs (one such task we participated in in the form of a video train), blockchains as well as cylic graphs. And an experiment of making a videograph by recording a video at the same time framing one other person and the recording ends when one person leaves any of  the frames. Then we all place the phones on the ground/table and and play them all at the same time.
<br>
I wasn't really worried about being a subject, I've taken part in films in 48 hours before and have made youtube videos etc which has removed any anxiety or shyness I may have once had long ago about being a subject recorded. Sometimes when I see my own image I think momentarily think things that I might like to be different about myself (eg balding hair etc( but I know I should also accept my body and the things that I can't change. We could be evolving with these devices as they're often used to capture our images and our lives. I didn't particularly feel attached to either my phone or my image, I felt I could trust the people around me. This activity could be drawn on to get people to understand each others feelings and to work together as a team.
<br>
He also introduced us to some of the machine learning artistic things circulating the industry at the moment. The likes of Dall-E and Midjourney. And a video that uses the technology in a unique way. Mask by FDK Knight otherwise known as Michael Logie. He wanted us to reflect on this and how it made us feel. Roman said he fed the story of Into the Maelstrom by Edgar Allan Poe. About the subtle nuiances about a developing technology and that it's not about this is going to replace artists because that's not what it's about and that it's about this new tool that is available.
<br>
I feel that this emerging technology is interesting, and has it's places but like Roman said that it's not going to replace artists. However I also feel that the art that this technology has already used is art that the artists have spent years developing. Contrary to that, it to me feels like it has the opportunity to go almost anywhere and be just about anything.
<br>
## Week 5:
<br>
This week we learnt a bit about Agile in working together, a short meeting and pitching ideas to solve each others problems.
<br>
##General Reflection:
<br>
Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
<br>
I did try to do this, standing up and walking around/stretching or getting a drink of water etc. However I didn't always remember if I got absorbed in my work
